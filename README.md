# ED_59
Source code for the Engineering Design course offered by the TU/e in Q1 of the 2021-2022 academic year. The product that group 59 chose to realize is the SecuriTap, a device meant to help people with early-stage dementia or suffering from forgetfulness.

### Running the code
The code is deployed on two NodeMCU (v2) boards, one "base station" that is connected to two servos and one "sensor module", which is battery powered and mounted to the spout of the tap. Below a schematic representation of the component parts of the product and their function is shown:
